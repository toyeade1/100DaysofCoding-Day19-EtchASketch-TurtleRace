# 100DaysofCoding-Day19-EtchASketch-TurtleRace


On this day, I created a program with the turtle module. One was a remake of the old ETCH&SKETCH game and another was a turtle race game where the user 
inputted a color they would want to win and then the race would be random, with a turtle winning when they crossed the finish line.
